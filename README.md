### 2. Integrated AI Tools

| Tool | Purpose | Automation Level |
|------|---------|------------------|
| **🤖 Gemini CLI** | Issue triage, code review, development assistance | Fully Automated |
| **💻 Claude Code** | Code generation, refactoring, quality assurance | Developer-Assisted |
| **🔧 dev.sh** | Environment setup, testing, deployment | One-Command |
| **📊 GitHub Actions** | CI/CD, notifications, integrations | Fully Automated |

### 3. GitHub Actions Workflows

#### Core Workflows
- **💬 Gemini CLI** (`gemini-cli.yml`) - General AI development support
- **🧐 PR Review** (`gemini-pr-review.yml`) - Automated code review
- **🏷️ Issue Triage** (`gemini-issue-automated-triage.yml`) - Real-time issue classification
- **📋 Scheduled Triage** (`gemini-issue-scheduled-triage.yml`) - Periodic issue management

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Clone and Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/upbond/development-guide.git
cd development-guide

# Make dev.sh executable (if present)
chmod +x dev.sh

# Start integrated development environment
./dev.sh
```

### 2. AI-Powered Issue Management

```markdown
# In any GitHub issue or PR, mention:

@gemini-cli investigate and fix this authentication error
@gemini-cli /review focus on security and performance
@gemini-cli /triage classify this issue
```

### 3. Development Environment

The `dev.sh` script provides a standardized development environment:

```bash
./dev.sh
# Choose option 1: 🚀 Start All Services
# → Backend API: http://localhost:8120
# → Admin Panel: http://localhost:8121  
# → Frontend: http://localhost:8122
# → Database: localhost:3809
```
